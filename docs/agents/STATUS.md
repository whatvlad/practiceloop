# Project status

The MVP features are not implemented yet. Tasks are the open GitHub Issues in
the Implementation Queue project (https://github.com/users/whatvlad/projects/1),
worked in `Order`. Live state is always GitHub Issues, pull requests, merged
commits and that project.

Frontend design (#26): the design system in docs/design/system is implemented
with mock data behind `frontend/src/data/api.ts`; the temporary stub in
`frontend/src/data/mock/` is replaced when the API (PL-010/011/012) lands.

Preview hosting (#28): `.github/workflows/pages.yml` deploys `frontend/` to
GitHub Pages on push to main; temporary until PL-014.
